# Deco MCP app

A full-stack template for building
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers
with a modern React frontend. This template provides a complete development
environment where your MCP server not only exposes tools and workflows to AI
agents but also serves a beautiful web interface built with React and Tailwind
CSS.

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 MCP Server**: Cloudflare Workers-based server with typed tools and
  workflows
- **⚛️ React Frontend**: Modern React app with Vite, TanStack Router, and
  Tailwind CSS
- **🎨 UI Components**: Pre-configured shadcn/ui components for rapid
  development
- **🔧 Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with auto-generated RPC client
  types
- **🚀 Hot Reload**: Live development with automatic rebuilding for both
  frontend and backend
- **☁️ Ready to Deploy**: One-command deployment to Cloudflare Workers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥22.0.0
- [Deco CLI](https://deco.chat): `npm i -g deco-cli`

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure your app
npm run configure

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8787` serving both your MCP endpoints
and the React frontend.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

- **`npm run dev`** - Start development with hot reload
- **`npm run gen`** - Generate types for external integrations
- **`npm run gen:self`** - Generate types for your own tools/workflows
- **`npm run deploy`** - Deploy to production

## 🔗 Frontend ↔ Server Communication

The template includes a fully-typed RPC client that connects your React frontend
to your MCP server:

```typescript
// Typed calls to your server tools and workflows
const result = await client.MY_TOOL({ input: "data" });
const workflowResult = await client.MY_WORKFLOW({ input: "data" });
```
